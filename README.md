# HardwareArchitectures
Super computing architectures  

This might be better called "cluster architecture" and represents the "blocks" that hold the cpus and interface to other clusters through the network.

How are CPUs clustered together and how do they communicate?  

It seems to be common for clusters to be on cards with direct communication and for cards to slot in through what looks like PCIe
